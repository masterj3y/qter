# Prerequisites
    Helm: Helm should be installed and configured.

**Installation**

Enable Ingress: If you're using Minikube, enable Ingress to ensure proper application routing:
Bash

    minikube addons enable ingress

**Configure Values**: Verify that the values.yaml file contains the correct configuration for your environment.

**Update Dependencies**: Download the required charts (MongoDB, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ):

    helm dependency update

**Install the Application**: Install the application using Helm:

    helm install qter . -n <name-space> -f values.yaml

   Replace `<name-space>` with the desired namespace for your deployment.

## Explanation:

**Minikube and Ingress**: Minikube provides a local Kubernetes cluster, and enabling Ingress is crucial for managing external traffic to your services.

**Values.yaml**: This file holds configuration settings tailored to your specific deployment. Ensure it's accurate to avoid issues.

**Helm Dependency Update**: This step fetches the latest versions of any charts listed in your Chart.yaml file.

**Helm Install**: This command deploys the application to your Kubernetes cluster using the specified values and namespace. 

## Additional Considerations:

**Namespace**: Using a dedicated namespace helps isolate different applications and manage resources effectively.

**Customizations**: You might need to modify the values.yaml file further based on your application's requirements.

**Helm Charts**: Ensure that the Helm charts you're using are compatible with your Kubernetes version and meet your specific needs.

## Troubleshooting:

**Check logs**: Use kubectl logs to inspect the logs of your deployed pods for any errors or warnings.
**Verify configurations**: Double-check the values.yaml file and the Helm chart configuration for any typos or **incorrect settings.
Inspect resources**: Use kubectl get pods,services,ingress to verify that the resources are created correctly.

By following these steps and carefully reviewing the logs, you should be able to successfully deploy your application using Helm.
